C++
In C++, arrays offer more low-level control, allowing the programmer to choose between stack and heap memory, and whether the size is fixed or dynamic. When using a Fixed Dynamic array, such as int arr[n];, the size is determined at runtime but cannot be changed afterward.
This type is stored on the stack and is only valid in compilers that support Variable Length Arrays (VLAs).

For Stack Dynamic arrays, C++ follows a similar approach — arrays are declared inside a function with a size known at runtime. These arrays exist only during the function's execution and are automatically destroyed when the function ends. Again, they reside in the stack 
and cannot change in size after creation.When arrays need to be created on the heap, C++ allows Fixed Heap Dynamic arrays using the new operator: int* arr = new int[n];. The array size is still set once at runtime, but memory is taken from the heap, and the programmer is
responsible for manually freeing it using delete[].For full flexibility, C++ uses the vector class from the Standard Template Library. Vectors are Heap Dynamic arrays that can grow or shrink during execution with functions like push_back(). They manage their own memory 
internally and are ideal for dynamic data needs.


JavaScript 
In contrast, JavaScript simplifies array handling by automatically managing memory. All arrays in JavaScript live in heap memory, and there is no distinction between stack and heap from the developer’s perspective. A Fixed Dynamic array is created using new Array(n),
which allocates an array with n undefined elements. Although resizable, the initial structure behaves like a fixed-size array.For arrays created within functions, JavaScript doesn’t enforce stack behavior, but when you define let arr = new Array(n); inside a function, 
it mimics the idea of a Stack Dynamic array in terms of scope — it’s temporary and local to the function, although still on the heap.The concept of Fixed Heap Dynamic arrays also maps to new Array(n) in JavaScript, where the array is initialized with a specific length. 
Unlike C++, there is no need to manage memory manually — the JavaScript engine’s garbage collector handles it.When working with Heap Dynamic arrays, JavaScript provides a natural syntax: let arr = []; followed by arr.push(x);. Arrays can grow indefinitely, support mixed 
data types, and adapt dynamically to changing data, all without the need for explicit memory management.
